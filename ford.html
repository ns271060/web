        1969 brought another major restyling to the Mustang. The Fastback 2+2 was gone – replaced by the new SportsRoof model. 
        The new Mustangs were almost 4 inches longer than their 67/68 predecessors. The base engine continued to be the 200 cubic 
        inch six cylinder. New for the economy minded Mustang owner was an optional 250 cubic inch six. The base V-8 continued to be 
        the 302-2V. The 351-2V and 4V entered the lineup for 1969. The 302-4V and the 390-2V were dropped, but the 390-4V remained.

      <p style="font-size:22px">The 1969 Mustang body was completely redesigned and different from the previous years. The 1969 major restyling of the Mustang 
        made it about 4 inches longer and shorter by 1.5 inches than the 1967/68 models. It was also heavier. The 1969 Mustang retained 
        the 108″ wheelbase of the original ’64½’s
        The 2+2 Fastback moniker was replaced with the new SportsRoof brand/model. To this day however, many of us “old- timers” still 
        call all sloped back Mustangs Fastback (as do we throughout the site). A version of the SportsRoof Mustang was the MACH1. Because 
        of the significant differences, it was considered a different body style and given its own code number.
        
        New features for 1969 Mustang model year included quad headlights, front parking lights were now located behind the front valance
         panel, new quarter panel ornaments, side scoops and integral rear spoiler on the SportsRoof models, front seat back locks, and for 
         the first time, the VIN number, in addition to being located on the driver’s door, was also attached to the instrument panel, and
          visible through the windshield.
