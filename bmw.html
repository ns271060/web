  <h1><b><i>2006 BMW M Roadster </i></b></h1>

  <h2>Price: 30,000</h2>
  <br><br>
  <p style="font-size:22px">
    BMW's latest M Roadster succeeds in two related ways: It grows some, ahem, "whiskers" on the otherwise
    masculinity-challenged Z4
    \with butch styling; and secondly, the implicit promise that the body makes is kept with honest-to-M3 muscle. More
    than a mere dress-up
    kit or sport pack, the 2006 M Roadster takes the finesse inherent in the Z4's already competent, baseline chassis
    and infuses it with
    heart-pounding performance
    derived from the M division's vast knowledge â€” with a little help from parts-bin raiding.
  </p>

  <br>
  <p style="font-size:22px">The M Roadster's more chiseled M-spec styling forecasts its speed and agility with a manly
    bravado the Z4 donor
    car only insinuates. Where the Z4 looks like an overreaching design student's idea of a roadster, the M Roadster's
    unique sculpting
    identifies it as the epitome of a real one.

    At the front, its unique grille and aggressive fascia allow for better engine and brake cooling. Standard
    self-leveling xenon headlamps
    (with BMW's "corona" rings) light the way. More than just a fashion statement, the 18-inch M double-five-spoke alloy
    wheels are surrounded
    by serious Continental ContiSport Contact tires that are not (thankfully) heavy run-flats. Instead, in the trunk you
    get a compressor and
    a can of goo to get you to the nearest shop for tire repair/replacement. The otherwise amorphous aluminum hood
    features longitudinal
    creases that must've been painstakingly located to precisely align with the driver's sight lines.

    Out back, there's an M-specific bumper ensemble with cutouts for the telltale quad-exhaust tips and a real air
    diffuser. The '06 M Roadster
    showcases new, adaptive LED taillamps (also on '06 Z4s) that light more brightly the harder the brake pedal is
    pushed. The overall effect of
    the M treatment to the exterior is supremely satisfying. Several times while driving the M Roadster, I saw lesser
    Z4s and my chest swelled
    with the satisfaction that comes from the exclusivity that all M variants offer their buyers. Riffing on the Z4's
    flame-surfacing
    (on a bar of soap) design netted a shape that looks like the car the Z4 should've been from the start.
