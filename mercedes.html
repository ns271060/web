  <p style="font-size:22px">
    The 2022 Mercedes-Benz A-class is a small car with the heart of an S-class luxury sedan. The expensive-looking
    fa√ßade helps it
    look right at home among the rest of the Benz lineup, and its modern, tech-filled cabin delivers much the same
    experience as pricier
    models. A turbocharged four-cylinder drives either the front or all four wheels, and the A-class's handling is
    fairly spry. We'll admit
    that it's not as quick as the related AMG-tuned CLA35, but it's still engaging to drive. Compared to rivals such as
    the BMW 2-series Gran
    Coupe and the Cadillac CT4, the A-class offers a more cohesive package and is more desirable than either of those
    entry-level luxury
    compact cars. </p>

  <br>
  <p style="font-size:22px">With entry-level luxury models, the cabin design can sometimes be heavy on the entry-level
    and light on the
    luxury. That isn't the case with the A-class. This sedan has an interior with a premium look that lives up to
    Mercedes-Benz standards.
    A trio of circular air vents adds decorative flair to the center stack, and the cabin can be upgraded with upscale
    options such as
    leather upholstery, heated front seats and LED interior lighting. The front seats deliver memorable comfort, and
    that helps make the
    A-class a great car for those who face long commutes. A standard folding back seat with a 40/20/40 split allows you
    to accommodate items
    too large to fit in the trunk. Speaking of the trunk, the A-class has one significant weakness: It's light on cargo
    capacity. The car's
    trunk provides just 9 cubic feet of room for your belongings.
