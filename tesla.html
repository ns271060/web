    control in all weather conditions. A carbon fiber spoiler improves stability at high speeds, all allowing Model 3 to
    accelerate from 0-100 km/h* in as little as 3.3 seconds.Tesla All-Wheel Drive has two independent motors for
    improved redundancy,
    each with only one moving part for minimal maintenance and maximum durability. Unlike traditional all-wheel drive
    systems,
    they digitally control torque to the front and rear wheels for far better handling and traction control. </p>
